# 🛠️ Debug Summary for SJVTDM GitHub Actions

## ❌ Issue

Despite correct configuration, GitHub Actions fails to:

- Persist `sent_articles.json` across jobs
- Properly fetch secrets (e.g., Reddit, Telegram, Twitter)
- Send messages to Telegram (randomly blocked or malformed)
- Detect "new articles" due to missing previous state

## ✅ What works

- Local execution works perfectly
- Messages are correctly sent when launched manually
- All sources (RSS, Twitter, Reddit) fetch articles normally
- Secrets in `.env` are loaded correctly locally

## 🧹 Current state

- GitHub Actions workflow `bot.yml` has been disabled (via Actions tab)
- Cron-based scheduling has been paused
- Focus is now shifted to a more stable long-term solution

## 🧪 Next Steps (alternatives under evaluation)

See `README` or team notes for upcoming deployment strategy.
